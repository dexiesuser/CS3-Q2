          <strong>KNEE SOCKS. </strong>Just before the 'AM' album concludes,
          there's a song that might be its best. We're bouncing as the memories
          in Alex's head come together in a final crescendo, which begins with a
          bass drum and basic guitar riff. Lyrics like "When you strolled around
          your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste... And your knee socks" tempt
          listeners to melt into the offered emotions. This performance, despite
          it not being in a headliner rock arena, is one of my favorites. I
          appreciate the comfort of small concert gatherings, and the crowd's
          cheer is not too overwhelming. As for the delivery of the song, what
          more can I say? Arctic Monkeys will always deliver, especially on this
          track. The suave and lulling performance of the band always sweeps me
          off my feet.

          <strong>FLUORESCENT ADOLESCENT. </strong>The ballad on their second
          album 'Favourite Worst Nightmare' is about growing older and realizing
          that life isn't as exciting as it once was. With an emphasis on how
          "rowdy" she was as a teenager, it tells the story of a lady who longs
          for her younger years because her monotonous and unfulfilling life
          today. Comparing this old recording to the previous 2013 recording I
          showed you before, you can see the change in the once
          pure-garage-rock-and-teenage-spirit band into the legends they are
          today. This performance, or rather the song as a whole, encapsulates
          teenage spirit the best for me. Not too rowdy, not too laidback. Also,
          this 'The Letterman Show' appearance will forever be iconic in my eyes.

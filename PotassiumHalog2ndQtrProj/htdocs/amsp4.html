        <h2>A (not very) Short Message from the Author</h2>
        <p>
          As one of the biggest bands of this decade, I admire this band
          wholeheartedly. This whole website proves on how much I love the band
          and their music. Since it's such a versatile band, I can listen to
          various tracks of them depending on my mood. From mellow jazz album
          openings like 'There'd Better Be A Mirrorball' to chaotic rock
          headbangers such as 'Pretty Visitors,' Arctic Monkeys has so much to
          offer. I'm quite sad that I would not be able to afford tickets for
          their upcoming Asia Tour here in the Philippines. As long as they
          contrinue to put out amazing music, I'm alright with being a forever
          #TeamBahay for this band.

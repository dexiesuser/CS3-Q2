		<h2> "Just another brit-rock band?"</h2> 
		<p> <strong>Beneath the Boardwalk </strong> was born when the band's demo CD started to circulate online. The Boardwalk in Sheffield, where the Arctic Monkeys formerly performed and Alex Turner once worked, was the location where the first sender received the samples, and in an effort to categorize them, he gave it that name. As more demos propagated online, they were all eventually grouped together under this heading. Due to this, many people have been led to believe mistakenly that Beneath the Boardwalk was an early album or that all of the early recordings were published under this title. </p>
